**CENTENNIAL CORPORATION** offers real time management services that can provide owner and lender both interim or long term property management.   These services are typically provided to companies in transition or in the turnaround phase where the services of predecessor key management no longer are involved and a property in acute need of stabilization and rehabilitation. 

Other candidates for this service are represented by Lending Institutions that find themselves in a interim ownership position and need immediate assistance in the evaluation, management, and sale of the property.  The Principal member’s skills include experience in serving in the positions of Chief Executive Officer, Chief Operating Officer, Chief Financial Officer, Chief Technology Officer, Chief Marketing Officer, Property Manager, Construction Manager, and various other senior management positions.

**CENTENNIAL CORPORATION** is willing and able to take hands-on operating control of a single real estate asset or large portfolio as its day-to-day interim management and guide it through the process of rehabilitation. Normal options in these types of transactions will carry the client property/portfolio to either the point of sale or to a point of solvency and/or stabilization allowing for a more passive environment in which to resolve the final issues at hand.

These **CENTENNIAL CORPORATION** interim management services have been provided on behalf of company owners, corporate boards, shareholders, as well as for creditors.

As most Lenders have come to realize, managing the interim operations of a real estate asset where certain issues of entitlements, construction, management, maintenance, and ultimate sale of the asset go far beyond the expertise and time management of the typical lender’s real estate department.
