**Realty Special Asset Solutions LLC (“RSAS”)** is a program strategically focused on providing asset protection services to lending institutions for its larger real estate special asset holdings.  **RSAS** services are concentrated on preserving, protecting and enhancing real estate assets currently, or about to be, owned or under the control of these lenders.  Each of the Principals of **RSAS** has worked in the real estate development community for more than thirty years.  Together they have been involved with the financing, acquisition, entitlement and/or build out of more than 15,000 homes, thousands of apartments, condominiums, multiple master-planned communities, as well as industrial and commercial centers throughout California and the Western United States.  As bank board members with over 20 years experience, **RSAS** offers a unique service.

During the span of these thirty years **RSAS** Principals have experienced exceptionally strong markets as well as severely depressed real estate markets.  They have participated in more than a billion dollars of debt and equity financing from both community and large institutional lenders.  **RSAS** Principals understand that:

> FOR CERTAIN LENDERS THEIR WORST NIGHTMARES ARE ABOUT TO COME TRUE

> LET US HELP YOU RESOLVE THE FASB REGULATORY CHALLENGES OF REAL ESTATE OWNED ASSETS

From internal bank governance to State and Federal Agency involvement, lenders must proactively protect their investments and assets in accordance to FASB rules.  As borrowers no longer perform and debt gets reclassified and shifted from department to department, the lender is in jeopardy of facing federal regulations that may be very difficult, and in some cases impossible, to withstand. 

Lenders must work directly with specialized real estate professionals to maximize asset protection, return of capital and even the possibility of increased earnings while all the time operating in accordance to FASB rules.  **RSAS** offers real time management services that can provide lenders both interim or long-term real estate property assessment and management.   From assets in need of acute stabilization and rehabilitation to periodic scheduled management, **RSAS** will provide asset specific services to lenders and financial institutions.
