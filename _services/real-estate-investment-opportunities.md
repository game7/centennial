Centennial Corporation’s Private Equities Group offers investment opportunities in Limited Liability Companies or Limited Partnerships that purchase time sensitive real estate assets.  PEG as it is known, looks for real estate properties that are benefitted by the changing financial markets, which create purchasing opportunities for it’s members.

PEG manages the acquisition, interim management, and sale of the real estate asset for “sophisticated investors” whose earnings and net worth signify them as a qualified investor within the guidelines set forth by Centennial Corporation.  Typically the individual investment is a minimum of $100,000 up to several million.  The investment period ranges from 3-5 years.  However each property has a different set of objectives which each potential investor should consider.

With the current turmoil in the residential real estate market caused by the problems relating to the sub-prime lending market, there will be some tremendous buying opportunities over the next two years.  PEG will be actively pursuing investment opportunities for its partners in both the residential and commercial markets.
