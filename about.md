## Current Trends and Client Services

With the current crisis within the financial lending institutions due to the problems associated with the sub-prime lending markets, Centennial Corporation affiliate **REALTY SPECIAL ASSET SOLUTIONS LLC (RSAS)** is consulting with banks large and small on the resolving the negative impacts from their Special Asset / REO portfolios.  Literally billions of dollars of real estate development loans will be foreclosed upon by lending institutions who will need to face the many problems created in the entitlement process of those properties which collateralize the loans.  RSAS specializes in solving entitlement issues and marketing strategies for Special Asset/REO properties facing maximum scrutiny by federal regulators.  Such scrutiny brings with it loss of value by forced write down of the loan, loss of earnings past and present from classification as a Special Asset.  All of which is mandated by certain regulatory practices of FASB 114 and accounting principles of GAAP.
